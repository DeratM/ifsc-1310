<h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
<P> My thoughts on web accessibility are that they are one of the most important things a website can have. Web accessibility for me means a website that has multiple ways to be used for people with different kinds of disabilities, for example, people with dexterity problems or eyesight issues to name a couple. The reason why this is so important is that these accessibility tools help users navigate and interact with websites that otherwise they wouldn't be able to. So I feel like accessibility for anyone with any kind of disability is a basic human right. Especially as web developers, we all have a duty to keep all types of users in mind, not only the able-bodied ones. Moreover, there are benefits to having a more accessible website. For example, all types of users will find it easier to use this website so they'll come back, in turn, this will cause traction to the website and raise its SEO, so more people will come and use it.

<h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
<p>After reading about Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation it seems like such an obvious issue yet it isn't. First, let me explain what is graceful degradation because it's somewhat the simplest one out of the two. Graceful degradation is the idea that web devs have a bias towards more advanced browsers. This bias causes these devs to put more time and effort into their websites for these “advanced” browsers and then leave the rest of the “crappy” browsers out or just make a worse version of the website. This bias is extremely unfair and just a crappy move when creating a website that is intended to hit a large audience. That is where the idea of progressive enhancement comes in. It's an idea presented by Steve Champion and Nick Finick. This idea explains that web devs should focus on content before anything so all users gain the same experience and information that is needed. I quite enjoy the example of the peanut M&M, the content is the peanut, the chocolate is the presentation, and the client-side scripting. Overall progressive enhancement is such an important thing in web development because as web developers we shouldn't have a bias towards one group of users. As web devs, we should focus on trying to make the best and easiest accessible websites, and with graceful degradation that isn't possible. Finally, this article by W3 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement">Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement</a>) explains great use cases where both Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation are needed.</p>

<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>Just a fair warning I got a little excited and didn't make a second version at first. When I got back from break and worked on my version 1 a couple of the changes I got recommended. However, I fixed the issue and made version 2 for the final fixes. The person who reviewed my website was my girlfriend, and she didn't hold any punches back and told me the truth. She saw many of the similar issues you saw. She disliked that I had a random point at the top of the page and that there was a weird margin applied at the top of the page. So when I got to class with your help I fixed both of that. Now one of the other issues she had was that all my images were different sizes and seemed very disorganized. As well as my text being very bland, I need to choose a better font. As well as my heading (dragon) should be a different color.</p>

<p>Now after fixing all of these issues, I feel fairly proud of my work. I've tried to hit everything both you and my girlfriend said, and even more. I made the NAV and the title way more visible as well as matched my color scheme. I've fixed all the images as well as the text. Also, I've now added all the pages. I got stuck in many parts but I adapted and learned. Google is an amazing tool. I was having so much trouble with the "Configurations'' part of my website. The boxes didn't float the way I wanted, but as I am writing this sentence the float demo popped back into my head. So I went back to the positioning lab and the position demo and I got it to work the way I wanted, and that was the best feeling in the world. I was at my end and wanted to quit but I got it. I'm extremely proud of my work. This assignment has been one of the most challenging I've ever received, but I loved every moment of it. It made me want to learn more and get even better and I can't even believe I've done all of this. The whole experience of this assignment has been an amazing ride.
