<h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
<P> My thoughts on web accessibility are that they are one of the most important things a website can have. Web accessibility for me means a website that has multiple ways to be used for people with different kinds of disabilities, for example, people with dexterity problems or eyesight issues to name a couple. The reason why this is so important is that these accessibility tools help users navigate and interact with websites that otherwise they wouldn't be able to. So I feel like accessibility for anyone with any kind of disability is a basic human right. Especially as web developers, we all have a duty to keep all types of users in mind, not only the able-bodied ones. Moreover, there are benefits to having a more accessible website. For example, all types of users will find it easier to use this website so they'll come back, in turn, this will cause traction to the website and raise its SEO, so more people will come and use it.
